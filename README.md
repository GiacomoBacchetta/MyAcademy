## Overview

Welcome to my personal learning repository!ðŸš€ 
This repository serves as a centralized hub to document and track my ongoing journey. 
I am Giacomo Bacchetta, a dedicated **Data Scientist** who greatly misses university exams and courses...
Nah, I feel I owe it to myself to continue studying, learning and delving into the fields that make up Data Science.
For each topic, I will follow a course trying to summarize the key concepts in the notes and develop to learn the most important techniques and technologies.

## Table of Contents

4. [AI Applied to Transportation Case Studies](#ai-applied-to-transportation-case-studies)

## Pyomo

In this section, I delve into Pyomo, an open-source optimization modeling language for Python. From basic concepts to advanced optimization techniques, I aim to build a comprehensive understanding of Pyomo and its applications. -->

## Computer Vision

The first topic I decided to cover is Computer Vision. It has always fascinated me, especially its applications in the automotive field.
The course I am taking is the one issued by Stanford University, [CS231N](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLf7L7Kg8_FNxHATtLwDceyh72QQL9pvpQ).

<!-- ## Time Series Analysis

Time series analysis is a crucial aspect of data science, and in this section, I will dive into various methods and models for analyzing time-dependent data. From traditional statistical methods to advanced machine learning models, I aim to master the art of time series analysis.

## AI Applied to Transportation Case Studies

Transportation is a fascinating domain, and I am particularly intrigued by the application of artificial intelligence in solving real-world transportation challenges. This section will showcase my exploration of AI techniques applied to transportation case studies, demonstrating how data science can enhance efficiency and decision-making in this field. -->

## How to Navigate this Repository

Feel free to explore each section based on your interests. Each topic will have its dedicated directory containing code snippets, notebooks, and documentation reflecting my learning journey. Contributions, suggestions, and discussions are always welcome!
